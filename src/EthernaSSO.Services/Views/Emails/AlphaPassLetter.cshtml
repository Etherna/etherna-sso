    <h1>@AlphaPassLetterModel.Title</h1>

    <p>Today is a very important day.</p>

    <p>After months of hard work, designing,<br />
        planning and developing greate features<br />
        the time has come to release Alpha Passes.</p>

    <p><b>@Model.UserName, you are among pioneers.</b></p>

    <p>We want to tell you that we are enormously grateful to you.</p>

    <p>Maybe you could think that you have done nothing,<br />
        but this is not the case.</p>

    <p>Every request for an Alpha Pass was fuel for us<br/>
        that powered the whole process of creation.</p>

    <p>Etherna is a community-based platform,<br/>
        and you are among first people who believed in this project.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>

    <h2>Things to know about Alpha 1 phase: Snowden</h2>

    <p>This phase of the project is the first alpha version.</p>

    <p>At this stage the platform is still missing several features,<br />
        needs optimizations and community feedbacks.</p>

    <p>But this is first version with foundamental working parts for the public.</p>

    <p>From now, we needs to grow and evolve with our community: you!</p>

    <p>At this stage you may find bugs, downtime<br />
        or you could have data loss.</p>

    <p>We apologize if this will happen,<br />
        but it is a physiological moment of every innovative application like this.</p>

    <p>With Alpha 1 you can add for free credit to your account,<br />
        and you can start to use the platform with it.<br />
        Free credit is valid only with Alpha 1.</p>

    <p>Withdrawals are still disabled,<br />
        and creator's rewarding will come soon,<br />
        among other features.</p>

    <p>You can find our roadmap <a href="https://info.etherna.io/#roadmap">here</a>.</p>
